  Output: "This is a lesson in text processing using some genomic data from vibrio cholera."

- Category: load
  Output: "Testing load question"
  Datafile: "data/sample.origin"
  
- Category: command
  Output: "I've loaded data for you into a long string named 'vc'. It's part of# a chromosome of vibrio cholera. Type vc now to see what it looks like."
  Answer: vc
  Hint: "Enter vc at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: command
  Output: "Use the Python command 'len' to see how long the string vc is."
  Answer: len(vc)
  Hint: "Enter len(vc) at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: text
  Output: "The data originally was 20 lines of 70 characters each. I've put it all in one string, vc, for you."

- Category: command
  Output: "You can access particular items in the string vc using the Python construct vc[i] which returns the i-th character in the string. Python uses 0-based numbering so the first character is vc[0] and the last is vc[len(vc)-1]. Print the first character in vc now."
  Answer: vc[0]
  Hint: "Enter vc[0] at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: getvalue
  Output: "You can also use negative numbers as indices in strings. vc[-1] returns the last character of the string, vc[-2] the second last character, etc. Print the third last character in vc now using a negative number as index."
  Value: 'A'
  Hint: "Enter vc[-3] at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: getvalue
  Output: "You can prove that I didn't lie to you by checking to see if vc[-1] equals the last character in vc, vc[1399]. Use Python's boolean construct vc[-1]==vc[1399] to check for equality."
  Value: True
  Hint: "Enter vc[-1]==vc[1399] at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: text
  Output: "Python also lets you access pieces or substrings of strings. vc[i:j] returns the i-th character, the (i+1)-st character,..., all the way to the (j-1)-st character. NOTE that the j-th character is NOT returned."

- Category: command
  Output: "Print out the 10 characters of vc starting with index 100."
  Answer: vc[100:110]
  Hint: "Since the character with the index after the colon isn't printed you need to use 110 as that index. Enter vc[100:110] at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: text
  Output: "If you don't give an index before the : Python assumes you want to start from the beginning of the string. If you don't give an index after the : Python assumes you want to continue until the end of the string."

- Category: multiplechoice
  Output: "What will vc[:] print out?"
  Choices: [the empty string, the full string, the first character, the last character]
  Answer: the full string
  Hint: "With no indices the defaults are the beginning and end of the string."

- Category: text
  Output: "You may have noticed that vc contains only 4 different characters, 'A', 'C', 'T', and 'G'. This is because vc is part of a genome. We'd like to count up how many times each character occurs in vc."

- Category: newvariable
  Output: "We'll do this in a simple way first then demonstrate for you Python's greatness with a faster way later. First, make a new variable ctrA and set it equal to 0."
  Variables: {'ctrA':0}
  Hint: "Enter ctrA=0."

- Category: newvariable
  Output: "Now we'll write a 3 line program to count the number of times the character A appears in the string vc.\nThe first line is the for loop,\nfor i in vc:\n    the second line tests if i equals 'A'\n         and the third line increments ctrA if the condition is true."
  Variables: {'ctrA':371}
  Hint: "for i in vc:\n    if i=='A':\n        ctrA += 1\n."

- Category: command
  Output: "Now see what ctrA is."
  Answer: ctrA
  Hint: "Enter ctrA at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: text
  Output: "We could repeat this process for the other three characters but that's a little tedious. It's also very inefficient, since we'd have to go through vc 4 times (once for each letter) instead of just once, tallying the characters as we went along."

- Category: text
  Output: "To do precisely this kind of problem Python provides a cool kind of list, a dictionary, which allows you to index elements with items that aren't integers. If we use characters as indices into the dictionary, then each indexed place can hold the count of how many times the index has occurred."

- Category: newvariable
  Output: "Use the construct 'd = dict()' to declare a dictionary named d."
  Variables: {'d':{}}
  Hint: "Enter d = dict() at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: newvalue
  Output: "Let's do another short program (5 lines) using the dictionary d. As before, the first line is a for loop:\nfor i in vc: \nThe second line checks if i isn't already in the dictionary using Python's not in construct.\n\tIf it isn't: d[i] is set to 1, \n\telse: it's incremented."
  Value: {'d':{'A' : 371, 'C' : 318, 'T' : 375, 'G' : 336} }
  Hint: "for i in vc:\n    if i not in d:\n        d[i]=1    else:        d[i]+=1"

- Category: command
  Output: "Now see what the dictionary d looks like."
  Answer: d
  Hint: "Enter d at the Python prompt >>>"

- Category: getvalue
  Output: "Calculate the sum of the elements of d to see if they add up to 1400, the length of vc. Remember you can use expressions d['A']+d['T']...  or you can type in the numbers you just saw ... or you can mix the two, expressions and numbers."
  Value: 1400
  Hint: "Enter d['A']+d['C']+d['G']+d['T']"

- Category: text
  Output: "Now for a quick review."

- Category: getvalue
  Output: "What is the 700th entry of vc?"
  Value: 'T'
  Hint: "Enter vc[699] at the Python prompt."

- Category: multiplechoice
  Output: "What will vc[-1:-1] print out?"
  Choices: [the empty string, the full string, the first character, the last character]
  Answer: the empty string
  Hint: "Recall that the item with the index after the colon is NOT printed, so the statement is saying 'print everything from the last character on but don't print the last character.' Nothing can be printed."

- Category: multiplechoice
  Output: "If x is the string 'abcde', what is x[1:2]?"
  Choices: ['ab', 'bc', 'b', 'bcde']
  Answer: 'b'
  Hint: "Recall that Python is 0-based indexing, so x[1] is the second character. The item with the index after the colon is NOT printed, so the statement is saying 'print the second character'."

- Category: multiplechoice
  Output: "If x is the string 'abcde', what is x[:2]?"
  Choices: ['ab', 'bc', 'b', 'bcde']
  Answer: 'ab'
  Hint: "Without an index before the : tells Python to start from the beginning of the string. The item with the index after the colon is NOT printed, so the statement is saying 'print the first 2 characters (indices 0 and 1)'."

- Category: command
  Output: "What expression prints out the 10 characters of vc starting at index 551?"
  Answer: vc[551:561]
  Hint: "Enter vc[551:561] at the Python prompt >>>"
